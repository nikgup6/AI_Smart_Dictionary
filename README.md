üìò Smart Dictionary: AI-Powered Chrome Extension
About the Project
Smart Dictionary is a Chrome extension that uses the power of AI to provide context-aware meanings and translations of words. Unlike a standard dictionary, this tool analyzes the surrounding text to give you the most accurate and relevant definition for any word you encounter while browsing the web. Simply highlight a word, and a small bar will appear with its meaning and usage examples.

üåü Features
Contextual Definitions: By analyzing the sentences before and after a highlighted word, the extension provides a meaning that is precise and relevant to the text.

Example Sentences: The extension gives two example sentences that demonstrate how the word is used, further enhancing your understanding.

Minimalist UI: A clean, non-intrusive floating bar appears only when you need it, ensuring a seamless browsing experience.

Efficient Back-end: The core logic is powered by a Python back-end that communicates with a powerful AI model.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Front-end (Chrome Extension): HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Back-end (AI Server): Python with Flask

AI Model: Google's Gemini API
